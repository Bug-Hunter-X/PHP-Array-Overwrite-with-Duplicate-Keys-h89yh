# PHP Array Overwrite with Duplicate Keys

This repository demonstrates a common error in PHP involving array overwrites when dealing with duplicate keys. The `bug.php` file contains a function `processData` that processes an array of data.  If the input array contains duplicate keys, the later value associated with that key overwrites the earlier value. The `bugSolution.php` provides a solution to handle these cases more appropriately.

## Bug
The core issue lies within the `processData` function. When a duplicate key is encountered, the old value associated with the key is silently overwritten. This can lead to unexpected behavior and data loss if not handled carefully.

## Solution
The solution demonstrates alternative approaches to handle duplicate keys.  This may involve using a different data structure or modifying the logic to deal with the duplicates appropriately, possibly by appending them to an array or using a different key-value arrangement.
